# Data Accuracy Notes

1. All dates and schedules are based on information available as of February 2026. Schedules can change.
2. GPS coordinates marked with ~ are approximate (derived from city/area data, not exact track pins).
3. Some events (Shotsu Drift 2026, YumeDrift 2026) have not yet announced specific dates.
4. The "Red Helmet Matsuri" does not appear to be a separately branded event -- it most likely refers to the Ebisu Drift Matsuri or a related sub-event.
5. Cage and tire requirements vary significantly between events. Always check the specific event's rules before attending.
6. Ticket availability and pricing change frequently. Use the official links provided.
7. For grassroots events, social media (Instagram, Facebook) is often the primary source for announcements.
