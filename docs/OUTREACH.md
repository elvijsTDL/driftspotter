# DriftSpotter -- Outreach List

> **Purpose:** This document is the DriftSpotter launch outreach list. It catalogues drift event organisers, media outlets, YouTube channels, influencers and professional drivers across every major drifting region. The goal is to build partnerships and awareness ahead of and during launch so that DriftSpotter becomes the default place people look when they ask "where can I watch or enter a drift event?" Use this list to coordinate email outreach, DM campaigns, cross-promotions and content collaborations as outlined in the [Go-To-Market plan](./GO-TO-MARKET.md).
